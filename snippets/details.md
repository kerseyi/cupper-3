What's that? An HTML accordion you say? Yup! It's called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">HTML Details Element.</a>
```html
<details>
  <summary>OOOH, WHAT'S IN THERE?</summary>
  <p>IT'S A PUPPY!</p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/this is fine.gif" alt="dog sits in burning house drinking coffee saying, this is fine"/>
</details>
```

As of July 2020, it's accessible out of the box -- although I did notice in my testing that the "expanded" and "collapsed" states are not toggled when there is no SUMMARY element nested in the DETIALS element.

The DETAILS element supports the TOGGLE event, so adding more functionality to it is pretty straightforward.
{{<demo>}}
details.addEventListener("toggle", event => {
  if (details.open) {
    /* the element was toggled open */
    //do awesome thing!
    } else {
      /* the element was toggled closed */
      // undo awesome thing
    }
  });
{{</demo>}}
